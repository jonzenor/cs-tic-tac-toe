# cs-tic-tac-toe
My first C# game, Tic Tac Toe. 2 player, no CPU.

This is a challenge from the Complete C# Masterclass by Denis Panjuta on udemy.

The rules: Have each place display the position number to be selected, fill it in with the users piece when they pick it, have it check for a win condition, and finally ask the player if they want to again and reset the board if they say yes.
